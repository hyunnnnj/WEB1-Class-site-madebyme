Let's go below zero and hide from the sun
I love you forever where we'll have some fun
Yes, let's hit the North Pole and live happily
Please don't cry no tears now, <strong>it's <u>Christmas</u></strong>, baby
My snowman and me
My snowman and me
Baby 
<p>Don't cry, snowman, don't you fear the sun
    Who'll carry me without legs to run, honey
    Without legs to run, honey
    Don't cry, snowman, don't you shed a tears
    Who'll hear my secrets if you don't have ears, baby
    If you don't have ears, baby</p>
<p style = "margin-top:30px;">I want you to know that I'm never leaving
    'Cause I'm Mrs. Snow, 'til death we'll be freezing
    Yeah, you are my home, my home for all seasons
    So come on, let's go</p>
