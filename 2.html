I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier 
I'm gonna live like tomorrow doesn't exist 
Like it doesn't exist 
I'm gonna fly like a bird through the night, feel my tears as they dry 
I'm gonna swing from the chandelier, from the chandelier 
<p>But I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes 
    Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight 
    Help me, I'm holding on for dear life, won't look down won't open my eyes 
    Keep my glass full until morning light, 'cause I'm just holding on for tonight 
    On for tonight 
    </p>
<p style = "margin-top:30px;">Sun is up, I'm a mess 
    Gotta get out now, gotta run from this 
    Here comes the shame, here comes the shame 
    
    One, two, three, one, two, three drink 
    One, two, three, one, two, three drink 
    One, two, three, one, two, three drink 
    
    Throw 'em back 'til I lose count</p>
